# glove
An easier installer for go
## How it works
Glove doesn't need to be updated every time Go gets an update, because the version you want to install is up to you (and the webserver)  
Basically, you get asked what version of go you want to install and gets set in a variable. This makes it easier to download, but harder to handle errors.
